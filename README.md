# Rally Web Platform Spike

_status: in development_

A demo supporting a Rally Web Platform spike, investigating whether we can move to a web-centric model and away from the rally-core-addon.

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Mozilla web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/)

This repository contains the code needed to build the Rally Study 01 Web Extension. 
The study submits data through [Mozilla Rally's Web Extension](https://github.com/mozilla-rally/rally-core-addon),
or can be run locally without Mozilla Rally installed on your computer.
